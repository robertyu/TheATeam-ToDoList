#Application Information:

The application uses Flask, Python, and SQL-Alchemy to implement the to-do list. 

Bootstrap was used for interfacing the list. The list can accept, edit, and delete tasks. 


#Team Roles and Responsibilities:

The team began working on the project with a spread approach, looking for possible implementations and sample works to test feasibility. The group then decided to split into two groups with one half 
(Earvin Train, JM Santos, RJ Jainani) addressing the front end interface 
and the other half (Gelli Dela Cruz, JL Oncinian) to address the back end database portion.

The front end team was responsible for merging the front and back ends of the application. 

They handled the HTML files, JavaScript, and CSS files for better presentation of the data.

There have been different options found for the backend, namely MongoDB, SQLAlchemy, and Peewee for database implementations.
The group tried to use Peewee for a little uniqueness in the project but was not able to properly learn and integrate with the front end implementation. 

As for the MongoDB, it was scratched because it seemed a lot of groups are already using it as well. Finally it was decided that SQLAlchemy was the better choice because it was easier to understand and was preferred by the group in general.

After the initial merging of the front-end and back-end, all five of the team helped in testing the application. 
All of them were also responsible for troubleshooting the problems encountered.
